Package: GliomaAtlas3D
===============

Version: 1.3.0 [2020-11-01]

NEW FEATURES:
* Now includes Gene Enhancer Accessibility data.
* Gene Promotor Accessibility data updated (new version).
* Samples that do not have data to display now do not appear in 3D plots (previously appeared but were yellow).

BUG FIXES:
* Removed non-spatially mapped v4 for P475 which was generating an error with the linear plots.

Version: 1.2.0 [2020-10-18]

NEW FEATURES:
* Now includes Gene Promoter Accessibility data.

BUG FIXES:
* Added tk and tcl install to Dockerfile as these are now required for successful loading of misc3d package.

Version: 1.1.0 [2020-07-17]

NEW FEATURES:
* Added a downloads page, where you can download both sample and tumor-level data.

BUG FIXES:
* x-axis tick labels no longer cut off in distance regression analysis plots.

Version: 1.0.0 [2020-07-13]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:
* Explore tab layout has been updated.

NEW FEATURES:
* Can now subset patients based on the type of tumor you are interested in (IDH-mut, codel, etc).

* Summary of molecular and tumor features now shown for the selected patient.

BUG FIXES: 
* Transferred over error handling from main navbarPage() to dataTab tabPanel() to fix stray “TRUE-tab-NNNN-N” output at bottom of each page.

* Replaced all instances of paste0() with file.path().

* Added in req() to all functions with upstream input dependencies to check requirements before proceeding, thus decreasing premature execution of 3D plotting.

* Fixed colorbar panel to prevent text from wrapping.

* Removed empty expansion files for patients for which expansions were not predicted, thus correcting an error that occurred when the user attempted to select Expansion Events as a data set for these patients.

* Added in correction term for mm to voxel, which is typically 1:1 in the x and y planes, but 1.5:1 for the z. This, combined with the different number of voxels in the z plane as compared to x and y as well was leading to distortion of the final 3D plot, whereby the final image was shorter on the z plane. This correction is calculated in plotTemplate() based on the xyz voxel dimensions + mm to voxel conversion (which can differ between scans, so cannot be hardcoded), and then passed into the aspect argument of plot3d.


Version: 0.1.0 [2020-05-13]

NEW FEATURES:

* New data types added - tumor cell clonal expansion events, cancer-associated process signatures, and cell type signatures.

BUG FIXES:

* colorByFeature can now handle an input vector of all of the same value (i.e. all 0s), and so certain patients for which data was failing to plot now can be visualized again. 

* removed non-spatially-mapped samples of otherwise spatially-mapped patients from input data txt and rds files

* added RNAseq .rds files that were missing for newest patients
